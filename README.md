- 👋 Hi, I’m @Gant67, and I want to build something very unique, but I don't possess the programing skills it would take to create it!
- 👀 I’m an Ideaman with interests in making money online, and online/offline marketing for small/medium and even enterprise businesses.
- 🌱 I’ve given up on trying to learn coding for the moment, due to the time frame it would take before I could aquire the necessary skills to acheive my goals! 
- 💞️ So I’m looking to partener with a collection of coders with different programing skills to join me in this business venture that would involve Revenue sharing 
- 📫 If you're interested or know of someone that might be or just want to learn more fill free to contact me @ this email address williamross313@gmail.com
